// Create a User class. This class will receive the user's first & last name, a username, a password, and an email. It will also have a 
// "subscribed" property which will be false by default.
// Create a subscribe method. This method will set "subscribed" to true if it is false, and false if it is true, and return a 
// string relevant to their new subscription status.
// Instantiate 5 new Users, and push them into an array.
// Create a function which receives an array. This function will call the subscribe method on any user whose name starts with "S", "M", or "L".
// Use the forEach method.
// Create a function which receives an array. This function will return a new array with only subscribed users.
// Create a function called "hack". This function will receive an array and return it with all the user values updated to your information.
// Use the map method.
